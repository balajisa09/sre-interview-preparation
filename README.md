  - Scripting questions (log parsing, api response parsing)

  #### 2. Linux
  - Operating system concepts (*nix implementation)
  - Networking concepts

  #### 3. System Design
  Not traditional system Design, but related something you would do as an Devops/SRE, like
  - Designing CI/CD 
  - Designing logging infrastructure at scale
  - Designing monitoring infrastructure at scale

  #### 4. Troubleshooting 
  - Explain a recent incident you faced and how did you solve it.
  - Given a scenario, gie me an explanation on how would you debug it, step by step.

  #### 5. Tools specific knowledge
